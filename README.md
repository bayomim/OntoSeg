This is an implementatio for OntoSeg algorithm

The code is documented in general.

The algorithm is written with NodeJs. You need to instal dependencies first using the package-lock.json file.

Then run the code as follows:

    > node Start_OntoSeg.js
    
 This version of OntoSeg works on data provided by (Kazantseva & Szpakowicz 2014): http://anna-kazantseva.com/content/
 
 In order to run OntoSeg on your data, you need to convert your data into classes from DBpedia.
 
 To do so, use the helper system (https://github.com/bayomim/BuildVSM)

Please cite our paper if you publish material based on this code or dataset.
